# Introduction

This repository includes my Tubitak studies. Most needed descriptions are explained inside of the notebooks.<br/> However, will be extended here later on. <br />
You can check the [datasets-for-natural-language-processing](https://www.kaggle.com/toygarr/datasets-for-natural-language-processing) that I use mostly.

Available Methods:

* SMOTE, BorderlineSMOTE and their Hybrid Versions which are created by me.
* Mixup Text Data Augmentation
